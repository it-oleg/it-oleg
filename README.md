# My name is Oleg Chebotaryov.

- 🌱 In 2020, I graduated from the Novomoskovskiy Institute of the D.I. Mendeleev Russian University of Chemical Technology with a degree in Automated Information Processing and Management Systems.

- 🔭 In 2020, I worked as a programmer at ExpressRMS for 6 months. But I quit due to my service in the armed forces. The main task was to support the operation of the system and the introduction of new functionality. During the work, it was possible to develop an integration module for data exchange with the My Warehouse warehouse system.
